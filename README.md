# FizzBuzz

ðŸ”® A short Elixir project, following a tutorial from a [Udemy course](https://www.udemy.com/course/elixir-e-phoenix-do-zero). Actually my first ever Elixir project!

## Features

- Reads a text file to get a list of integers
- Converts these numbers using the following criteria:
  - When divisible by 3, the number gets converted to "Fizz"
  - When divisible by 5, the number gets converted to "Buzz"
  - When divisible by 3 and by 5, the number gets converted to "FizzBuzz"
- Returns a list with the converted numbers
- Unit test coverage for the only public method

## Considerations

Really a great first project, got to use some fundamental stuff in functional programming, like **pattern matching**, and also important things about Elixir and it's good practices in general, like **pipe operator** and **guards**.

This is basically my introduction to functional programming, I've tried *really basic* Haskell and liked it, but since Elixir's syntax is so close to Ruby's, I'm starting to really love this and hope this is the start of something big.

ðŸ¤ž Wish me luck from now on!
